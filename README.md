The package contains useful tools for all stages of the QM/MM workflow, form MD, to QM, to multiscale QM/MM.
As the package is designed spcifically for accelerating research in the Kulik group, 
much of the functionality is built around the Amber-TeraChem workflow, 
although some functionality is software agnostic.
